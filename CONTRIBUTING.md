## Branching and Release Strategy

- All development should be performed in short-lived feature or fix branches, branched from `main` (e.g., `feature/your-feature`, `fix/your-bug`).
- Submit changes via pull request (PR) to the `main` branch. All PRs require review before merging.
- The `main` branch is always deployable and production-ready.
- Releases are created by tagging the `main` branch with a version (e.g., `v1.2.3`).
- After merging a PR intended for release, bump the version in `package.json` and create a new release tag.
- Optionally, for larger releases, you may use a `release/` branch for last-minute fixes before tagging.

This workflow keeps the repository simple and friendly for open source collaboration, while ensuring code quality and a clear release process.
